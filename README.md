# Running Particle Swarm Optimization on Graphic Processing Units

This is an implementation of a version of the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm in Graphic Processing Units (GPU) using CUDA. You can read about this implementation in details [here](https://www.intechopen.com/books/search-algorithms-and-applications/running-particle-swarm-optimization-on-graphic-processing-units) and [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220981758_Impact_of_the_random_number_generator_quality_on_particle_swarm_optimization_algorithm_running_on_Graphic_Processor_Units).
